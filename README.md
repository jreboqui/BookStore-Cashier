# BookStore-Cashier
Bookseller Program from Starting Out with C++ Book

All cpp files are separated on this one. This version ask the user for input but does not do anything to the input right now. No input validation as well. Main changes are in the cashier.cpp where we ask several inputs including string inputs with the use of getline method. Then formatted so it shows at then end as a summary receipt which also has calculations for the book being sold and taxes added to it.
